A community thrives with the participation of its members. Developing a one-stop destination for all interested in ACT, we would need a lot of help. In this text I will brief on different ways one could contribute on this website. <!--more-->

## Blog Posts

To make the website content rich we need informative posts on topics pertaining to ACT. Interested people can reach out to discuss potential topics, moreover, as long as it's related to ACT it will be most welcomed. To make a post on the website, either email the site administrators or make a pull request on Github. In either case, editors will review the posts and approve once they are in the right format.

The posts must be written in markdown so that they can be posted with minimal effort. The math is rendered using MathJax with ```$<math>$``` and ```$<math>$``` as inline and block delimiters. Look at the source of published posts on Github for examples of usage.
